At work I wanted to present some timelines for our projects as pieces of 
paper we could shuffle. This was to get a better idea of timescales.
In short, I wanted to create a physical gantt chart.

I could have done hand-drawn pieces, but as there were quite a few projects
I wanted to represent, I thought I could whip up a python script to
generate the pieces for me. 

This program generates coloured rectangles of varying length. It is designed
that a 12-[unit] project fits on a landscape A4 page.

Run dev.py to generate some example strips. There really isn't much to the
code and it will take me longer to write about it than it will take you
to read dev.py - and dev.py uses the complete functionality of this repo
